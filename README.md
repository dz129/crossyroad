Final project for CS1100

The assignment was to use the pygame and gamebox modules to create any simple game to play.

I thought this assingment was a little bit rushed and also a lot of it was hard coded which i felt bad about doing. However, it's just a simple project and was my first ever "big" one. This was made before my other repositorie.
I want to make another big python project but i dont know when I'll do that again.
